Hi there!

This is Dani √Ålvarez, front-end developer based in Barcelona

For the exercise, I use Gridlex framework, because...well...I want to try it instead of bootstrap or similar

Well, I don't have much time for the test and just make the layout. No functionality, no JS and even not completely responsive (the exercise don't specify it, but with the Framework allows so easily)

well, thanks for your time and for the opportunity and hope to wet some feedback soon

Regars

Dani
